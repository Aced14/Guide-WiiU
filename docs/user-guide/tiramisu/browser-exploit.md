# Tiramisu

## Browser Exploit {docsify-ignore}

We first need to launch the Homebrew Launcher through the browser exploit.
Make sure your Wii U has internet access for this step.

### Instructions {docsify-ignore}

1. Take the SD Card out of your computer and plug it into your Wii U console.
1. Launch the Internet Browser and navigate to the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`.
1. Click on `Run Homebrew Launcher!`. Your console should launch the Wii U Menu and activate Tiramisu.
    - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.
1. Hold START (+) after clicking the `Run Homebrew Launcher!` button.
    - This will bring you to the Tiramisu Boot Selector which is needed for the next steps.
