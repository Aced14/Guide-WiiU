# Tiramisu

## SD Preparation {docsify-ignore}

We will now place the required CFW files and some additional homebrew files on the SD Card.

?> **Notice**
    Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, use [GUIFormat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) with 32k (32768) allocation unit size to format it. </br> **Do not** label the SD Card as `wiiu` or it will cause issues with homebrew.
